### Go in Action
- **Chapter 1 - Introducing Go**
  - Go is designed for distributed teams coordinating via Git/GitHub, etc.
  - Go tools simplify using and publishing packages.
  - Objective --> solving modern programming challenges
    - few language keywords
    - robust standard library
    - fast compilation
      - simplified dependency resolution
    - Cross-platform Windows/Mac/Linux
  - built-in concurrency
    - goroutines, like threads, but less memory and less code.
      - executed against a set of pre-configured logical processors - each LP is bound to a single thread.
    - channels - send typed messages between goroutines
  - simple and effective hierarchy-free type system
    - embedded types/composition to reuse functionality
  - Unique interface system
    - express behavior of a type
    - typically aligned with single actions
  - garbage collection
