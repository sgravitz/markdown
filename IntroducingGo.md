### Introducing Go
- **Chapter 1 - Getting Started**
  - GOPATH
  - Hello World app - does not need GOPATH
  - Comments: either // or /* followed by */
  - goDoc command - good resource
- **Chapter 2 - Types**
  - Numbers
    - Integers
      - uint8,uint16,uint32,uint64 , int8,int16,int32,int64
      - byte=uint8
      - rune=int32
      - machine dependent: uint, int, uintptr
      - in general, use 'int'
    - Floating Point
      - float32 and float64
      - NaN=not a number and positive and negative infinity
      - Complex numbers: complex64 and complex128
  - Strings
    - made up of individual bytes with a definite length
    - use len(stringValue) to get length
    - access by index is zero-based
    - Use + for concatenation
    - double quotes - single line and can use escape characters (\n \t)
    - back ticks ` - can span multiple lines
    - [n] to get byte value, string() to get char --> "Hello"[1] = 101 = 'e'
  - Booleans
    - represented as: true/false
    - && - and
    - || - or
    - ! - not
